See the [wolfSSL Manual](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/index.html).

The [wolfSSL embedded TLS library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/) is a lightweight, portable, 
C-language-based SSL/TLS library targeted at IoT, embedded, and RTOS environments primarily because of its size, 
speed, and feature set. It works seamlessly in desktop, enterprise, and cloud environments as well. 
wolfSSL supports industry standards up to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.3, 
is up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL, offers a simple API, an OpenSSL compatibility layer,
OCSP and CRL support, is backed by the robust [wolfCrypt cryptography library](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl/tree/master/wolfcrypt), 
and much more.

The CMVP has issued FIPS 140-2 Certificates #3389 and #2425 for the wolfCrypt Module developed by wolfSSL Inc.  
For more information, see our [FIPS FAQ](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/) or contact fips@wolfssl.com.

# Getting Started

Check out the Examples on the right pane of the [wolfssl component page](https://components.espressif.com/components/wolfssl/wolfssl/).

Typically you need only 4 lines to run an example from scratch in the EDP-IDF environment:

```bash
. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py create-project-from-example "gojimmypi/mywolfssl^5.7.1-Preview2f1"
cd wolfssl_benchmark
idf.py -b 115200 flash monitor
```

or for VisualGDB:

```bash
. /mnt/c/SysGCC/esp32/esp-idf/v5.1/export.sh
idf.py create-project-from-example "gojimmypi/mywolfssl^5.7.1-Preview2f1"
cd wolfssl_benchmark
idf.py -b 115200 flash monitor
```


### Espressif Component Notes

Here are some ESP Registry-specific details of the wolfssl component.

#### Component Name

The naming convention of the build-system name of a dependency installed by the component manager
is always `namespace__component`. The namespace for wolfSSL is `wolfssl`. The build-system name
is thus `wolfssl__wolfssl`. We'll soon be publishing `wolfssl__wolfssh`, `wolfssl__wolfmqtt` and more.

A project `cmakelists.txt` doesn't need to mention it at all when using wolfSSL as a managed component.


#### Component Manager

To check which version of the [Component Manager](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/getting_started/index.html#checking-the-idf-component-manager-version) 
is currently available, use the command:

```
python -m idf_component_manager -h
```

The Component Manager should have been installed during the [installation of the ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/#installation). 
If your version of ESP-IDF doesn't come with the IDF Component Manager, 
you can [install it](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/guides/updating_component_manager.html#installing-and-updating-the-idf-component-manager):

```
python -m pip install --upgrade idf-component-manager
```

For further details on the Espressif Component Manager, see the [idf-component-manager repo](https://github.com/espressif/idf-component-manager/).

# wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS Library

The [wolfSSL embedded SSL library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/) 
(formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS library written in ANSI C and
targeted for embedded, RTOS, and resource-constrained environments - primarily
because of its small size, speed, and feature set.  It is commonly used in
standard operating environments as well because of its royalty-free pricing
and excellent cross platform support. wolfSSL supports industry standards up
to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.3, is up to
20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers such as ChaCha20,
Curve25519, Blake2b and Post-Quantum TLS 1.3 groups. User benchmarking and
feedback reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over
OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt cryptography library. Two versions of
wolfCrypt have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). FIPS 140-3 validation is in progress. For additional
information, visit the [wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/)
or contact fips@wolfssl.com.

## Why Choose wolfSSL?

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded, desktop, mobile, or
enterprise SSL/TLS solution. Some of the top reasons include size (typical
footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB), support for the newest standards
(SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, DTLS 1.0, DTLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.3),
current and progressive cipher support (including stream ciphers), multi-platform,
royalty free, and an OpenSSL compatibility API to ease porting into existing
applications which have previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete
feature list, see [Chapter 4](https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)
of the wolfSSL manual.

## Notes, Please Read

### Note 1
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default.  wolfSSL also no longer
supports static key cipher suites with PSK, RSA, or ECDH. This means if you
plan to use TLS cipher suites you must enable DH (DH is on by default), or
enable ECC (ECC is on by default), or you must enable static key cipher suites
with one or more of the following defines:

```
WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH
WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK
```
Though static key cipher suites are deprecated and will be removed from future
versions of TLS.  They also lower your security by removing PFS.

When compiling `ssl.c`, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
`WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES` in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're
not using TLS cipher suites.

### Note 2
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having `SSL_connect` succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, WOLFSSL_VERIFY_NONE, NULL);
```

before calling `wolfSSL_new();`. Though it's not recommended.

### Note 3
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with `--enable-opensslextra` (`OPENSSL_EXTRA`) or with the
macro `NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES`. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a
single call hash function. Instead the name `WC_SHA`, `WC_SHA256`, `WC_SHA384` and
`WC_SHA512` should be used for the enum name.


# wolfSSL Release 5.7.2 (July 08, 2024)

Release 5.7.2 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA
process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.
https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance

NOTE: * --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

## Vulnerabilities
* [Medium] CVE-2024-1544
Potential ECDSA nonce side channel attack in versions of wolfSSL before 5.6.6 with wc_ecc_sign_hash calls. Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the order of the elliptic curve. Analyzing the division through a control-flow revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction methods. Thanks to Luca Wilke, Florian Sieck and Thomas Eisenbarth (University of LÃ¼beck) for reporting the vulnerability. Details will appear in the proceedings of CCS 24.
Fixed https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7020


* [Medium] CVE-2024-5288
A private key blinding operation, enabled by defining the macro WOLFSSL_BLIND_PRIVATE_KEY, was added to mitigate a potential row hammer attack on ECC operations. If performing ECC private key operations in an environment where a malicious user could gain fine control over the device and perform row hammer style attacks it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used and to build with WOLFSSL_BLIND_PRIVATE_KEY defined. Thanks to Kemal Derya, M. Caner Tol, Berk Sunar for the report (Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute)
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7416


* [Low] When parsing a provided maliciously crafted certificate directly using wolfSSL API, outside of a TLS connection, a certificate with an excessively large number of extensions could lead to a potential DoS. There are existing sanity checks during a TLS handshake with wolfSSL which mitigate this issue. Thanks to Bing Shi for the report.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7597

* [Low] CVE-2024-5991
In the function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the Openssl compatibility function X509_check_host() takes in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. While calling without a NULL terminated string is very uncommon, it is still technically allowed. If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non*NULL terminated buffer, the code would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7604

* [Medium] CVE-2024-5814
A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello when downgrading from TLS 1.3.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7619

* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 response verification bypass issue when a crafted response of length 0 is received. Found with internal testing.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702

* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 revocation bypass with a retry of a TLS connection attempt. A revoked CA certificate could incorrectly be loaded into the trusted signers list and used in a repeat connection attempt. Found with internal testing.
Fixed in github pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702
